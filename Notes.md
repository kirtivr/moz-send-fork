# Notes

Most of the code is in the following directories:
1. app/ [seems to have the client side code]
    app/readme.md
2. server/
    server/bin/dev.js is the entry point. server/config.js is a good place to start. See server/readme.md.

Good places to start learning about how this works:
1. test/ folder contains super helpful tests.
        test/readme.md
        http://localhost:8080/test
2. docs/ folder contains documentation.
